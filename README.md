# Final-Project 
Start with Variables, using Figma design system.
    Note: 
        Variables need to be in var.css file.
        Use the same naming format that you have in Figma.

Create an individual HTML, and CSS file fpr each component.
    Example:
        btn.css, and btn.html

Work on complex components after finishing the smaller components (atomic system).
    Example:
        Card component: If there will be a button in the card, make sure you have the button ready 1st.


Common style will live in style.css
